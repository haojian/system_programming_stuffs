Environment:
Works or solaris & ubuntu. I had tested the code on flare.

Compile command on flare:
/development/SUNWspro/bin/cc uniqify_v7.c -o test


Run command:
./test <input file path> <number of sorting processes>
Example:
./test datafile 5

'datafile' in the hw#2 is a sample test file.
