Grade: 85


Comments:

Doesn't compile under Solaris. For future assignments you must make sure your code comiles and runs under Solaris. Used either the machines in the computer lab or ssh to flare.mathcs.emory.edu.
Doesn't handle even sized files correctly, needs and extra '\n' at the end of an even length file.
Segmentation fault for -t, -v, -d and -x, strtok not working as intended. Works fine when fixed.
